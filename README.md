These codes are used to analyze the scattering patterns in a customized 2D lasers scattering system. We can extract the structure factor in a colloidal assembly. The original work is published in ACS Nano (https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.5c22049). 
Please cite this work if these codes are used. The codes are orignial written by Shuhong Xiang in Ming Xiao Lab.
